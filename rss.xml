            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Assignment of a Lifetime: Riding in a U-2 Spy Plane at the Edge of Space</h1><p>Back in 2010, San Francisco-based photographer Christopher Michel received a once-in-a-lifetime photo assignment from the US Navel Institute: to ride in the back seat of a U-2 spy plane at the "edge of space." At the plane's cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground, temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04f6c0633f5a485f90dde99e96cd653a67f86bd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere. So, just how did the newly-discovered Crater 2 manage to pull off this feat, like a deer leaping from the interstellar bushes to stare us down through our collective headlights?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3b53f341e9bfa1b291542ff36d386f62/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--KJc-Uo0o--%2Fc_scale%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2Fssbcmy6vcoq8ggiiinid.jpg"></article>]]></description>
