title: Venturing into the unknown…
publisher: {}
description: >-
  In science we are constantly struggling to expand the knowledge of humanity.
  To step out of the circle of the “status quo” of knowledge means to venture
  into unknown territory and chart it. Such venturing guarantees unexpected
  struggles but also offers hope for life-long fame. What will you find? Fame?
  Frustration? …or maybe just what you expected?  Scientists are able to design
  highly complex hypothesis-driven experiments, like the recent quest for the
  Higgs Boson, just to prove that they already knew what would await them in the
  uncharted territory. However many unexpected results discovered by descriptive
  works are the true game changers.  Both approaches can yield extremely
  valuable insights and are best combined. In the end their common ground, their
  motivation is the longing for knowing what lies beyond.

Such **venturing** guarantees unexpected struggles but also offers hope for life-long fame. What will you find? Fame? Frustration? ...or maybe just what you expected?
